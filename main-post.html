              <p>Hello folks! Welcome back üëãüèª I trust you are doing well.

                As you probably figured from the title, today I'd like to talk about impostor syndrome. I know what
                you're thinking:
                "Ah, another one of these posts... Bye üôÑ". Just hear me out before you leave. I promise I won't make it
                too long (at
                least not 30 minutes long).</p>
              <blockquote>üö® <i> #1: Be warned; this one sounds like a rant. Not suitable for the faint at heart.
                  Proceed at your own risk
                  or hit the back button before you regret it.</i></blockquote>

              <h3>Brief intro ‚úçüèª</h3>
              <p>
                I've been wanting to write about this topic for a while now, but I just couldn't find the words to
                approach this topic.
                After a conversation with @theowlsden , I finally got the clarity I need it, and here I am, finally
                writing about it.

                Let's settle this topic once and for all, shall we?</p>

              <h3>What is impostor syndrome? ü§î</h3>
              <p> sorry to reiterate this point here, but I need a baseline. For those unfamiliar with the term, here's
                a definition I
                found on Wikipedia:</p>

              <p>
              <h5>
                <i>
                  Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents
                  or accomplishments and
                  has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Despite external evidence of their
                  competence, those
                  experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have
                  achieved.
                </i>
              </h5>
              </p>
              <p>As you can see from the definition above, impostor syndrome is entirely mental and often fictitious. I
                personally
                believe that those experiencing it or those who have experienced it, are to blame for feeling this way
                (this includes me
                too). What I mean by this is that we effectively engage in self-sabotaging activities, therefore
                increasing the
                likelihood of falling victim to impostor syndrome. We literally bring this upon ourselves with our
                actions.</p>

            <img class="mx-auto d-block" style="width: 200px" src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="img">
            <br>
            <p>Now, let me be very clear about one thing: impostor syndrome !== self-doubt! I've heard and seen some
              folks say that
              impostor syndrome is not real and that it is just a fancy term used to refer to self-doubt. I don't agree
              in the least
              with such statement. In fact, I am under the impression that the folks making such statement, have not
              experienced
              impostor syndrome. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I personally believe that self-doubt is
              merely a part
              of what makes up impostor syndrome as a whole.

              In the next sections, I'll be sharing with you what I believe are key contributors to impostor syndrome.

            <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£ Unrealistic expectations üí≠</h5>
            Expectations, we all have them, yet they are not inherently bad in nature. Having expectations is good to
            some extent,
            so long they are realistic. Unrealistic expectations are the key ingredient for disappointment and do far
            more harm than
            good.

            Say you just landed a great job and things are going great. However, on one good day, your inner impostor
            rises and
            takes control.</p>
            <br>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" style="width: 400px" src="https://picsum.photos/900" alt="img">
            <br>

            <p>
            <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£ Comparing yourself to others üò¢</h5>
            You know the drill: you hop on your social media of choice and scroll through your feed until you are almost
            brain dead.
            Awesome! While scrolling through your feed, you see all these awesome folks you look up to. You can't help
            but think one
            (or all) of the following:

            "Oh, X is so cool! I wish I could be like them..."
            "Man, how I wish I had that many followers..."
            "Damn, I'd love to work for Y; that's my dream company! X is so lucky to be working there... I hope I can
            make it to Y
            one day..."
            </p>

            <br>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" style="width: 300px" src="https://picsum.photos/400" alt="img">
            <br>

            <p>
            <h5>3Ô∏è‚É£ Not accepting that you are a beginner üòï</h5>
            This one is closely related to setting unrealistic expectations. I see many skip the beginner phase. They
            never state a
            role they held with the word junior on their resume (they typically omit the word junior altogether). Why
            would they,
            right? Everyone's a senior dev straight out of college/uni/bootcamp, RIGHT? Obviously not! üôÑ

            By ignoring your humble beginnings, you don't help yourself. You just corner yourself further and make the
            encounter
            with your inner impostor more inevitable (just like Thanos üòâ). At this point, you are already falling in
            the vicious
            circle that is setting unrealistic expectations. By not acknowledging where you are currently standing in
            your career
            you'll wind up expecting yourself to be at a level much higher than the one you are currently on. To top it
            all, you'll
            get in the way of your growth, both personal and professional.
            </p>

            <img class="mx-auto d-block" style="width: 350px" src="https://picsum.photos/500" alt="img">
            <br>

            <p>
            <h5>4Ô∏è‚É£ You don't give yourself enough credit üèÖ</h5>
            You accomplish something? You don't acknowledge it. You hit a milestone? You don't celebrate that win.
            People compliment
            your work? You invalidate their compliment. See? I was right. All you do is self-sabotage! You get in your
            own way over
            and over and over again. Yet somehow, you hope you'll feel better about yourself by engaging in these
            destructive
            behaviors. Truly delusional...

            If all you do is keep yourself small, how do you expect to grow? Take pride in what you do and have
            accomplished and
            continue building on top of it. Change your mindset (especially how you see yourself and think about
            yourself) and
            notice how everything around you starts changing too.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>The end üôåüèª</h5>
            Hooray, you made it this far down! üéâ Thanks for tuning in for this one. Smash that üíñ or ü¶Ñ if you believe
            this should
            have been a TEDx speech. Just kidding!

            I truly hope that you could take away something from this rant (if not you may want to read this again ü§≠).
            I'd love to
            hear your thoughts on this topic, so don't hesitate to drop them below. Let's keep it civil and
            constructive, shall we?

            Now, say your goodbyes to your inner impostor!
